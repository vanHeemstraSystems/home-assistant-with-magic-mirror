# 100 - Introduction

[MagicMirror²](https://magicmirror.builders/) is an open source modular smart mirror platform. With a growing list of installable modules, the MagicMirror² allows you to convert your hallway or bathroom mirror into your personal assistant. MagicMirror² is built by the creator of the [original MagicMirror](https://michaelteeuw.nl/tagged/magicmirror) with the incredible help of a growing [community of contributors](https://github.com/MagicMirrorOrg/MagicMirror/graphs/contributors).

MagicMirror² focuses on a modular plugin system and uses [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/) as an application wrapper. So no more web server or browser installs necessary!
