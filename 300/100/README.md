# 100 - Docker

We will be using [Docker](https://gitlab.com/khassel/magicmirror) to configure and run our instance of Magic Mirror2.

See also the GitLab repository at https://gitlab.com/khassel/magicmirror

And the documentation at https://khassel.gitlab.io/magicmirror/

We have three use cases:

### 100 - Scenario server ‚òùÔ∏è: Running the application in server only mode.

This will start the server, after which you can open the application in your browser of choice. This is e.g useful for testing or running the application somewhere online, so you can access it with a browser from everywhere.

We'll be following this use case!

See [README.md](./100/README.md)

### 200 - Scenario electron ‚úåÔ∏è: Using docker on the raspberry pi and starting the MagicMirror on the screen of the pi using electron.

### 300 - Scenario client üëå: Using docker on the raspberry pi and starting the MagicMirror on the screen of the pi using another running MagicMirror instance.
